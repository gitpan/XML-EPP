=head1 NAME

XML::EPP - an implementation of the EPP XML language

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use XML::EPP;

 my $foo_create = XML::EPP->new(
         message => XML::EPP::Command->new(
             action => "create",
             argument => XML::EPP::SubCommand->new(
                 payload => XML::EPP::Obj::create->new(
                     ...
                 ),
             ),
             clTRID => "xml_epp_".time."_$$",
         ),
 );

 print $foo_create->to_xml;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an implementation of the XML protocol used by most
major domain registries around the world.  This protocol was developed
between 2002 and 2004, using XML standards which were at the time very
new, such as XML Namespaces and XML Schema.  It saw several
incompatible revisions until the 1.0 version which became RFC3730.

This module hopes to create a Free Software, complete, user-friendly
and standards compliant interface to both client and server sides of
the EPP specification.

=head2 WARNING: SITE^WMODULE UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The classes which are present, while enough to be able to parse the
RFC, are not fixed in API terms until they are documented and tested.
Please consider any attribute which is not yet at least documented to
be under review and subject to rename.  This is thought to lead to a
clearer implementation than fixing attribute names to the somewhat
random (though well-known) names used in the EPP XML.  Use of C<sub
BUILDARGS { }> to allow either may be considered; patches welcome.

Similarly with undocumented portions of the implementation.  If you
would like to make sure that the code you write against it doesn't
need rewriting, please send a patch/pull request!

This module currently implements the XML part of the protocol only;
converting this into an actual EPP session is currently TO-DO.  Also,
none of the mappings for essential registry types, such as domain,
contact or host are yet implemented.  This is a preview release.

=head1 PARSING AN EPP MESSAGE

This part currently works very well.  Feed in some valid XML
I<thusly>;

  use XML::EPP;
  my $message = XML::EPP->parse( $xml );

If you can find B<any> RFC5730-valid document (including RFC5731,
RFC5732 or RFC5733) this doesn't parse, then you win a bag of
chocolate fish.  Similarly if you find an RFC-invalid document that
this module accepts blindly.  Please log an RT ticket and contact the
author privately for delivery of the chocolate.

=head1 CREATING AN EPP MESSAGE

There is an example in the C<SYNOPSIS>, but essentially the regular
Moose constructor is all that is provided in this module.

=head2 HINTS

Look out for convenience construction interfaces.  These are primarily
useful C<coerce> rules (see L<Moose::Util::TypeConstraints>).

For example, instead of writing (in the middle of constructing a
L<XML::EPP::DCP> stack):

    recipient => XML::EPP::DCP::Recipient->new(
            same => 1,
            ours => [
                 XML::EPP::DCP::Ours->new( name => "SomeCo Ltd" ),
                 XML::EPP::DCP::Ours->new( name => "Partner Ltd" ),
            ],
        ),

Coerce rules are defined to make this work:

    recipient => [ qw(same), "SomeCo Ltd", "Partner Ltd" ];

Both construct the same stack of objects, and would serialize to:

  <recipient xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <ours><recDesc>SomeCo Ltd</recDesc></ours>
    <ours><recDesc>Parnet Ltd</recDesc></ours>
    <same/>
  </recipient>

For this to be most useful, the rules are hand-written for each class.

=head1 GLOBALS / CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<@XML::EPP::epp_versions>

The list of EPP versions implemented by this module.  Default value is
C<("1.0", )>.

=head2 C<@XML::EPP::epp_lang>

The list of EPP languages implemented by this module.  Default value
is C<("en", )>.

=head2 register_obj_uri( $uri[, $namespace])

Register the namespace C<$namespace> as corresponding to the C<$uri>
URI.  Object types such as L<XML::EPP::Domain>, etc will use this to
register themselves.  The loaded object types are available in the
global variable C<@XML::EPP::obj_uris>

=head2 register_ext_uri( $uri[, $namespace])

Exactly the same as the above, but the URI will be advertised as an
extension, not an object type.
