README for XML::EPP
===================

This package in an implementation of the XML part of the EPP protocol,
as described in RFC5730.  Currently, it does not implement any of the
other RFCs which are normally considered 'core' EPP standards - ie,
the domain, contact and host mappings.  It also does not yet implement
an actual client which speaks the stateful SSL protocol defined in
RFC3734.

The API here is released as a preview to the shape and style of the
API to come.  As the module is used, it will see updates,
implementation of the other EPP standards, and possibly integration
with modules such as Net::SSLeay::OO for a complete client API.


Installing
----------
The application is designed to be installed like a CPAN module; so use
the usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  sudo make install

The CPAN module dependencies will be highlighted during the first
command. If you do not have 'sudo' installed, you can use:

  su root -c make install
